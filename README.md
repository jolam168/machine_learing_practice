Text-to-Image Gradio Interface
==============================

This project demonstrates a text-to-image model using Gradio, a Python library for creating customizable web-based user interfaces for machine learning models.

Installation
------------

To run this project, you need to install the following Python libraries:

-   Gradio
-   Pillow
-   torch
-   torchvision

You can install them using the following command:


`pip install gradio Pillow torch torchvision`

Usage
-----

To run the Gradio interface, simply run the `text_to_image_gradio.py` file using Python:


`python text_to_image_gradio.py`

This will start a Gradio interface that allows you to enter text and generate an image based on the text using the text-to-image model.

This project was inspired by the DALL-E 2 OpenAI paper and codebase by lucidrains. The text-to-image model used in this project was trained using the Text-to-Image Synthesis example in the DALL-E 2 codebase.
